### Thought:

Class structure: 
- ahead of assignment students are given all relevant documentation and slides/essays going over confusion.
- piazza/campuswire is provided for asking questions
- In class
    - If first class of assignment:
        - Go over solution to final step from previous assignment (if applicable)
        - Introduce whole assignment, goals, prerequisites, concepts, etc. ~ half of class
        - Introduce first file(s) that will be worked on. Students code for rest of class. (Perhaps give students multiple days if file is long/hard)
        - Code is submitted for review before next class (or before moving on to next file if long/hard) along with any questions
    - If not first or last class of assignment:
        - Show teacher solution to previous file. Explain and discuss with students. Give teacher solution to students.
        - Introduce next file(s) that will be worked on. Students code for rest of class. (Perhaps give students multiple days if file is long/hard)
        - Code is submitted for review before next class (or before moving on to next file if long/hard) along with any questions
    - If last class of assignment:
        - Show teacher solution to previous file. Explain and discuss with students.
        - Introduce next file(s) that will be worked on. Students code for rest of class. (Perhaps give students multiple days if file is long/hard)
        - Students must submit a full working copy of the assignment before the next assignment. Their copy should include all of the code they submitted after previous classes (commented out if it was incorrect) as well as working code (copying from instructor's copy is fine) AND an explanation of what/why their original code was correct or incorrect. (Perhaps line it up with a weekend so they have more time). Note that the final step will have to be completely student's code, as that is not provided by the time the assignment is due.
Notes:
- The code actually running at the end of the assignment should be only part of the grade (50%?). They should also be graded on their description of what their original code did wrong and why (or why it was correct). E.g. Is their explanation accurate? Does it demonstrate that they understood the concept?
- Assignment difficulty can be tuned by how long/hard the final step is.
Cons:
- Con: Almost certainly gameable. Ideally this is run as a lettered class and kept small to encourage only students who truly want to learn to join.
- Con: Depending on assignments, certain steps may not be runnable until other pieces are completed. Assignment design should minimze this but it is likely unavoidable. 
- Con: Hard/time-consuming to grade (mitigated by small class size)
Pros:
- Pro: Assignments can be kept short and sweet and no student will get left behind.
- Pro: Students learn best from going over their mistakes. Encourages them to figure out WHY they went wrong, not just HOW

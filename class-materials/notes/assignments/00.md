### Intro
This lesson is designed to help students get setup with an environment that will let them develop `umass-os`. Students are expected to be familiar with command line environments but are not expected to know any of the tools we will be using, although having at least some knowledge of them will be helpful. 

The lesson should have covered the basics of how to use all of the tools mentione above. This assignment aims to help the students cement their knowledge through hands-on experience, while also making something that will be immeidately useful to them in the next assignment.

They will be tasked with cloning the `xv6-riscv` repository, building and running the development docker container using the provided `Makefile` (it works for both `umass-os` and `xv6-riscv`), and writing an entry point for the docker container that uses tmux to build and run `xv6-riscv` with `make qemu-gdb` in one pane and launches `gdb-multiarch` in another. When the assignment is done the student should be able to run `make docker-run` and boot directly into a live debugging instance.

This is an endless spin ðŸ¤”? What's the point of that. Remember
that a computer has no idea what it's executing, even though
our program ends here, the CPU will happily keep executing
whatever random instructions it finds after this, possibly
damaging itself in the process. If something goes wrong and 
the code leaves the input loop above, it will hit this and 
hang here, preventing the CPU from doing anything dangerous.
